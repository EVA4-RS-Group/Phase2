# Session 5 - Human Pose Estimation


## 1. Executive Summary
**Group Members:** *Ramjee Ganti, Srinivasan G, Roshan, Dr. Rajesh and Sujit Ojha*

### **Objectives**:

- You are implementing "[Simple Baseline for HPE and tracking](https://github.com/Microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch)". Read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06208.pdf) and write a detailed readme file describing the model architecture as well as the JointsMSELoss class.
- Download the [smallest model](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AFkTgCsr3CT9%2D%5FA&id=56B9F9C97F261712%2110709&cid=56B9F9C97F261712) and upload to Lambda for HPE detection
- Make sure to draw the points on the image, as well as connect the joints in the right fashion.
